### Info:
To be able to run this on your machine you need MySQL, Apache, and PHP you can install each one separately like I did or just install WAMP (http://www.wampserver.com/en/) which I recomend doing. I also recomend using a virtual machine.

**Note: If you have PHP 5.3 and above don't worry about the below message**

I am using PDO php so you will have to make some changes to your php.ini file, here are the instructions: http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.installation.php *remember to restart php (and Apache just to be sure) so that your changes take effect.
